## Banking and Credit

If you bank with TD Canada Trust in Canada, you can take advantage of a couple different services they offer. First, you can transfer USD from Canada to the US, and vice versa, for free. 

Second, if you're like me and have a solid credit history in Canada, but are just building your credit in the US, TD can use your Canadian credit history, and give you a TD Bank based credit card, that reports to the US credit agencies. This is _huge_ for boosting your American credit history - my TransUnion VantageScore jumped about 60 points thanks to this.

RBC offers a similar service, however, I've never used them, so YMMV.
