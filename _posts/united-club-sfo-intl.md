As an avid travel hacker-in-training, I've always wanted to try hanging out at an airport lounge before a flight. On my recent flight from SFO, I had the chance to try out the United Club in the international terminal for pretty cheap, so here's a quick run down of the place.

I purchased a one time pass off of Craigslist (they're often sold for $15-20, as they're given away for free with the Chase/United MileagePlus credit cards), and since I had a boarding pass for that day, I could enter the lounge. Do note, you don't need a flight with United to enter a United Club lounge with a one time pass - just a valid boarding pass for the same day. Personally, my flight was back to YVR on Air Canada.
