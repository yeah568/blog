## Visas

## Social Security

Nearly everything in the US requires a Social Security Number. Get one. Fast.

I got mine about a week after I visited the Social Security Administration, although both of my friends who were also in the US this term had issues with their SSNs not arriving, and had to visit more than once. It's a good idea to go as soon as you can, in case issues arise and you need to resubmit an application or otherwise sort things out with the SSA. 

Once you get your SSN, you can start building a credit history, set up direct deposits, and generally be able to do things without the extra hassle of explaining why you don't have an SSN.

## Banking and Credit

If you bank with TD Canada Trust in Canada, you can take advantage of a couple different services they offer. First, you can transfer USD from Canada to the US, and vice versa, for free. 

Second, if you're like me and have a solid credit history in Canada, but are just building your credit in the US, TD can use your Canadian credit history, and give you a TD Bank based credit card, that reports to the US credit agencies. Seemingly though, this only works for the TD Aeroplan Visa Signature, not the other cashback/TD Points cards, which is a shame, as this particular card has an annual fee of $95 after the first year. However, this is still _huge_ for boosting your American credit history - my TransUnion VantageScore jumped about 60 points thanks to this. 

RBC offers a similar service, however, I've never used them, so YMMV.

If you don't want to 

I signed up for a bank account with Chase on my first day in the US, and as suggested by the banker at the branch I visited, I applied for a Chase Freedom card after about three months. With the direct deposits from my employer showing up in my account every two weeks, plus a boost to my credit history from my Discover it Secured and TD Aeroplan Visa Signature card, I was approved with a pretty decent limit.
